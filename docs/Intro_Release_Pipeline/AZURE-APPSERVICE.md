You need to provide a few details to create the App.

**App Name**: Enter the name of the application.
Since this needs to be an unique name, an option is to include the name of the team or your initials as part of the name.

**Subscription**: Keep the default value.

**Resource Group**: Select **Create new** for the Resource Group and enter the name of the Resource Group.

**AppService Plan / Location**: Also create a new App Service plan, enter the name of the plan, the location (select West Europe) and select Standard Pricing Tier.
The standard pricing tier is required later, when we are going to stage the application using deployment slots.
