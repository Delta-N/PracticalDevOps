Lab - DevOps introduction
====================================================================

In this lab we will introduce some of the DevOps Practices presented in this workshop.
This will not be a hands-on lab, discuss with the other attendees what practices you are familiar with, what practices you are already applying and what practices are still on your backlog.  

Navigate to the [DevOps Learning Guide](https://www.visualstudio.com/devops/) and explore the contents.

Take some time to explore practice like: 
> Continuous Integration
> Continuous Delivery
> Infrastructure as Code
> Application Monitoring (Telemetry)
> Agile Practices

Articles discussing the [DevOps journey from Microsoft](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/devopsmsft-overview/) will also present valuable insights.
We will also present some slides during this lab to discuss the DevOps practices explored during this workshop.
